<ul>
    <li>
        Checking the complement of the target and the current number is a good validation check.
    </li>
    <li>
        Trading space for speed is a common way to optimize algorithms.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the two-pass hashtable method, the key point is to have a way to lookup the complement's index in constant time O(1).
        <ul>
            <li>A <b>key-value record</b> (hashtable) can be used to lookup the complement (key) to get its index (value) without having to iterate through the array again.</li>
            <li>
                The tricky part was determining what the key and value were. A mental model for this could be:
                <blockquote>
                ðŸ§  I need to find an index in the array without looping through again. I know I can get a constant time lookup using a hashtable. What can I compute as my key that will give me the index I want in the array?
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The two-pass hashtable can be improved to one-pass by doing the lookup while building the hashtable.
    </li>
    <li>
        What would help us come up with this optimization ourselves?
        <ul>
            <blockquote>
                One pattern to recognize is that we do not need the full hashtable to check for the complement.
                Even if we don't find the complement in the early part the array, the inverse complement will be found later.
                ex. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] target = 4. We won't see 3 when we start the loop but we will see 1 when we get to 3 eventually.
            </blockquote>
