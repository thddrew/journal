Key points:
<ul>
    <li>
    Fast/slow pointers are useful for finding a cycle in a list because an object moving at 2x speed will catch up to an object moving at 1x speed, when it has traveled the length of the list.
    </li>
    <li>
    Subsequently, when the fast pointer has reached the end of the list, the slow power will be at the halfway point.
    </li>
    <li>
    In left/right pointers, we can evaluate two values in one pass. A sorted array helps us determine which pointer to move since moving the left will increase the value and the right will decrease the pointer's value.
    </li>
</ul>
