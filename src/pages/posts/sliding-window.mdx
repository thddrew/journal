Key points:
<ul>
    <li>The sliding window works in O(n) time because we visit each character at most twice. The hashmap of last seen indices helps us skip validating every substring.</li>
    <li>We can skip substrings computed before the repeated character and after the repeated character because we know that every one of those substrings will contain both duplicates no matter what.</li>
</ul>
