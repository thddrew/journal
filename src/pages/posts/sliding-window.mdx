Important points to remember:
<ul>
    <li>The sliding window works in O(n) time because we know the last seen index of each char using the hashmap.</li>
    <li>We can skip substrings computed before the repeated character and after the repeated character because we know that each of those substrings will contain both duplicates no matter what.</li>
</ul>
